# errors.SEARCH_JOB_NOT_FOUND

## NAME

SEARCH_JOB_NOT_FOUND — the referenced asynchronous search job does not exist in the current tenant.

## SYNOPSIS

HTTP: `404` `Not Found`. Retryable: `no`.

## DESCRIPTION

Polling a search job by ID returns this error when the job ID is unknown or belongs to a different tenant. Jobs are tenant-scoped; a valid job ID from one tenant will not be visible to another.

Verify the job ID returned when the search was submitted. If the job was submitted successfully, check that the polling request uses the same tenant credentials.
