// Package parity holds the shared end-to-end test scenarios that every
// cyoda-go storage backend must satisfy. The scenarios are exposed as
// exported Run... functions taking *testing.T and a BackendFixture, plus
// a registry (AllTests) that per-backend wrappers iterate to run every
// scenario against their backend.
//
// The package depends only on stdlib, the generated OpenAPI client, and
// the generated gRPC/CloudEvents client. It does not import any package
// under internal/, so it is importable by an external Go module — in
// particular by out-of-tree storage plugins that want to validate their
// own backend against the same scenarios.
