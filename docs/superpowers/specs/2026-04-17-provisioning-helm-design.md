# Provisioning: Helm Chart — Design

**Status:** draft · **Date:** 2026-04-17 · **Target:** Kubernetes deployment via Helm

**Depends on:** [2026-04-16-provisioning-shared-design.md](./2026-04-16-provisioning-shared-design.md) (shared foundations — binary behavior, schema-compatibility contract, secret hygiene, production floors)

**Sibling specs:** desktop (shipped PR #45), docker (shipped PR #54)

---

## 1. Scope and goals

This deliverable produces the Helm chart operators use to run cyoda-go on
Kubernetes, plus the small binary-side changes the chart requires, plus the CI
that validates the chart on every PR.

### In scope

1. **Helm chart** at `deploy/helm/cyoda/` — production-ready v0.1.0 chart that a
   cluster operator can install with `helm install cyoda cyoda/cyoda -f values.yaml`
   and get a working single-replica-or-multi-replica cyoda-go backed by an
   external Postgres, fronted by Gateway API (default) or a still-maintained
   Ingress controller (transitional).
2. **Binary-side changes** folded in under Gate 6 (resolve, don't defer):
   - New `cyoda migrate` subcommand that runs schema migrations and exits.
   - `_FILE` suffix support for every credential-shaped env var
     (`CYODA_POSTGRES_URL`, `CYODA_JWT_SIGNING_KEY`, `CYODA_HMAC_SECRET`,
     `CYODA_BOOTSTRAP_CLIENT_SECRET`). Reads value from the file named by
     `<VAR>_FILE` when the plain `<VAR>` is unset; `_FILE` wins if both are set.
   - Removal of the stdout-print-on-generate behavior for
     `CYODA_BOOTSTRAP_CLIENT_SECRET`. Coupled-predicate validation: in
     `jwt` mode, `CYODA_BOOTSTRAP_CLIENT_ID` and
     `CYODA_BOOTSTRAP_CLIENT_SECRET` must be coupled (both set, or both
     empty); half-configured states are rejected at startup with a clear
     error that names both vars. The bootstrap M2M client is only created
     when `CYODA_BOOTSTRAP_CLIENT_ID` is non-empty (app.go:186 call site);
     a secret without an ID would be silently ignored, so we reject it.
     In `mock` mode both are ignored.
3. **Chart CI** at `.github/workflows/helm-chart-ci.yml` with two layers:
   - Layer 1 (every chart-affecting PR): `helm lint`, `helm template` with
     multiple values overlays, `kubeconform` against Kubernetes 1.31 + Gateway
     API 1.2 schemas.
   - Layer 2 (chart-affecting PRs + `main`): `ct install` on a kind cluster
     with a Postgres sidecar and Envoy Gateway, smoke test on `/readyz`.
4. **Ingress-port NetworkPolicy template**, default ON
   (`networkPolicy.enabled=true`) as defense-in-depth alongside the
   bearer-gated `/metrics`. Restricts admin-port ingress to
   operator-declared namespaces (default: namespace labelled
   `kubernetes.io/metadata.name: monitoring`) and gossip-port ingress
   to the chart's own pods. Operators on non-enforcing CNIs should
   explicitly set `networkPolicy.enabled=false` to avoid a silent
   no-op policy.
5. **Activation of the two pre-stub release workflows** that already live in
   the repo:
   - `release-chart.yml` — triggered by `cyoda-*` tags, uses
     `helm/chart-releaser-action@v1` to publish the chart to the `gh-pages`
     branch as a Helm repository (served at
     `https://cyoda-platform.github.io/cyoda-go`).
   - `bump-chart-appversion.yml` — triggered by binary `v*` release tags
     (non-prerelease), opens a PR bumping `Chart.yaml` `appVersion` to match.

### Out of scope (filed as follow-up issues — see §8)

- Layer 3 CI: multi-replica cluster-mode install with gossip coordination.
- `helm upgrade` migration-path testing (requires two chart versions).
- Ingress2Gateway-based migration guide for operators.
- Gateway API `PolicyAttachment` patterns (rate limiting, auth filters).
- Chart v0.2+ optional features (HPA, PodMonitor alternative,
  external-secrets-operator integration, fine-grained egress NetworkPolicy).

### Non-goals

- Bundled Postgres as a chart subchart. This was considered (an earlier brainstorm
  iteration landed on "Bitnami postgresql subchart, disabled by default") and
  then rejected: the chart's operator audience operates Kubernetes clusters and
  has a Postgres story of their own; the Bitnami ecosystem's 2025-2026
  licensing turbulence adds dependency-tracking cost; and the "I just want to
  try it" path is already served by `docker compose up` (shipped in PR #54).
  **The chart has zero `Chart.yaml` dependencies.**
- sqlite and memory storage backends in Helm. The ConfigMap hardcodes
  `CYODA_STORAGE_BACKEND=postgres`; no user-facing knob to override.
  sqlite-in-a-pod needs a PVC, breaks cluster mode, and defeats the chart's
  value proposition; those workloads are served by the desktop binary or
  Docker compose.
- Chart-managed TLS certificates. Operators use cert-manager (or equivalent)
  and reference generated certs via `tls.secretName` in the routing config.
- Chart-rendered `Gateway` resource. Operators are expected to run a shared
  platform Gateway; the chart renders only `HTTPRoute` and `GRPCRoute` that
  `parentRefs` into it. Rendering a per-app Gateway is an anti-pattern that
  creates N LoadBalancers for N apps.

### Principles enforced by the layout

- **One resource kind per template file**, named for the kind. Matches
  Bitnami/Grafana/Loki convention. Readers find things by filename.
- **`values.schema.json` validates invariants at render time.** helm 3+
  validates values against the schema before template rendering, so bad inputs
  fail with a clear error rather than rendering silently-broken manifests.
  The schema enforces:
  - `gateway.enabled && ingress.enabled` → rejected (they conflict on routing).
  - `gateway.enabled` requires: `len(gateway.parentRefs) >= 1`,
    `len(gateway.http.hostnames) >= 1`, `len(gateway.grpc.hostnames) >= 1`.
    Empty hostnames on an `HTTPRoute`/`GRPCRoute` inherit from the parent
    Gateway's listeners, which is ambiguous on a shared Gateway carrying
    multiple apps — enforce explicit hostnames to avoid accidental
    route-conflict.
  - `ingress.enabled && (ingress.http.host == "" || ingress.grpc.host == "")` → rejected.
  - `replicas >= 1`.
  - `postgres.existingSecret` and `jwt.existingSecret` are required non-empty strings.
  - `extraEnv[]` items must match `{name: string, value: string}` OR
    `{name: string, valueFrom: object}`. Open-ended env injection with
    shape validation — operators can inject `OTEL_*` plain-value vars and
    `valueFrom.secretKeyRef` entries (e.g., OTel auth headers) alike.

There is no `storage.backend` values knob. The ConfigMap hardcodes
`CYODA_STORAGE_BACKEND=postgres` unconditionally. Operators who want
sqlite/memory are not the Helm chart's audience (they have the desktop
binary or Docker compose). Adding a values knob for it is a footgun
(sqlite-in-a-pod needs a PVC; memory backend is process-local).
- **`_helpers.tpl` holds all shared template logic.** Individual templates stay
  focused on their one resource.

---

## 3. Workload and networking

### StatefulSet (always)

The chart renders the cyoda workload as a StatefulSet regardless of replica
count. Reasons:

- **Stable network identity.** `metadata.name` of each pod is predictable
  (`cyoda-0`, `cyoda-1`, ...), which lets the chart derive
  `CYODA_NODE_ID` from the pod name via the Downward API — no operator
  config needed, works at any replica count.
- **No workload-kind flip on scale-up.** `helm upgrade` cannot cleanly
  transition a Deployment → StatefulSet (the kind field is immutable on the
  resource path). Locking StatefulSet always means scaling from 1 → N is a
  values change, not a chart-breaking migration.
- **No operational penalty at `replicas: 1`.** StatefulSet-with-one-replica
  is a well-established pattern (Grafana, Gitea, single-node Postgres
  operators). Empty `volumeClaimTemplates` means it behaves identically to a
  Deployment from the operator's point of view.

### Cluster mode always on

There is no `cluster.enabled` flag. The chart wires cluster mode
unconditionally because:

- Binary already supports a single-member cluster path (see
  `internal/cluster/registry/gossip.go` — logs "no seeds configured,
  proceeding as cluster of one"). Cluster-of-one is a first-class runtime
  mode.
- The only friction `cluster.enabled=false` ever saved was "operator doesn't
  need to provide an HMAC secret." The chart auto-generates the HMAC secret
  via `lookup` (see §4), so that friction is gone.
- **Scaling is a one-flag change:** `helm upgrade --set replicas=3`. No mode
  flip, no second flag, no values coordination. The StatefulSet rolls; new
  pods discover each other via the headless service; `gossip.go` transitions
  from "cluster of 1" to "cluster of 3".

### Pod specification

Key elements (condensed — full YAML lives in the implementation plan):

- **Security context** (pod + container):
  - `runAsNonRoot: true`, `runAsUser: 65532`, `fsGroup: 65532` (distroless
    `nonroot` UID). This depends on the shipped image using
    `gcr.io/distroless/static:nonroot` (or an equivalent UID-65532 base) —
    documented as an invariant in the Docker per-target spec at
    `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-17-provisioning-docker-design.md`. If
    the image base changes, both specs need a coordinated update.
  - `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`. cyoda writes nothing to local disk when
    backed by Postgres.
  - `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, `capabilities: { drop: [ALL] }`,
    `seccompProfile: { type: RuntimeDefault }`. Pod Security "restricted"
    profile compliant.
- **ServiceAccount:** dedicated `cyoda` SA per install, no RBAC bindings
  (cyoda doesn't talk to the kube API). `automountServiceAccountToken: false`
  on the pod — defense in depth against a stolen pod-local token.
- **Ports on the container:** `http:8080`, `grpc:9090`, `metrics:9091`,
  `gossip:7946`.
- **Downward API env:** `CYODA_NODE_ID` from `metadata.name`,
  `POD_NAMESPACE` from `metadata.namespace`, used to compute
  `CYODA_NODE_ADDR` = `http://$(CYODA_NODE_ID).cyoda-headless.$(POD_NAMESPACE).svc.cluster.local:9090`.
- **Config env:** `CYODA_STORAGE_BACKEND=postgres`, `CYODA_IAM_MODE=jwt`,
  `CYODA_REQUIRE_JWT=true`, `CYODA_POSTGRES_AUTO_MIGRATE=false`
  (migrations run in the Job, not the pod), `CYODA_ADMIN_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0`
  (necessary for ServiceMonitor scraping from the `monitoring` namespace).
- **Credential env (all `_FILE`-form):** `CYODA_POSTGRES_URL_FILE`,
  `CYODA_JWT_SIGNING_KEY_FILE`, `CYODA_HMAC_SECRET_FILE`,
  `CYODA_BOOTSTRAP_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE`. All four point at
  `/etc/cyoda/secrets/<name>`.
- **`extraEnv`:** open-ended operator env injection. Typical use: OTel
  (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`, etc.), feature flags.
  The chart does not render an OTel-specific schema; operators wire OTel
  through `extraEnv`.
- **Probes:** `livenessProbe` on `/livez`, `readinessProbe` on `/readyz`,
  both on the `metrics` port (admin listener). `initialDelaySeconds: 10/5`,
  `periodSeconds: 10/5`, conservative defaults.
- **Volumes:**
  - `secrets` (`projected`, `defaultMode: 0400`): mounts all four
    credentials at `/etc/cyoda/secrets/` in a single volume. Each source
    references the appropriate Secret (operator-provided for DSN/JWT,
    chart-managed for HMAC/bootstrap) and projects into the expected
    filename.
  - `tmp` (`emptyDir: {}`): mounted at `/tmp`. Safety net for any Go stdlib
    call that uses `os.TempDir()`.
- **Resources:** defaults `requests: {cpu: 100m, memory: 256Mi}`,
  `limits: {cpu: 1000m, memory: 512Mi}`. Operators override via
  `resources` in values.
- **`volumeClaimTemplates: []`** — intentionally empty.

### Services

- **`cyoda`** (ClusterIP): single Service, three named ports.
  `http:8080 → containerPort http`, `grpc:9090 → containerPort grpc`,
  `metrics:9091 → containerPort metrics`. Selector matches the StatefulSet
  pod labels. This is the industry convention (Grafana, Prometheus, Loki,
  Tempo, Elasticsearch, Keycloak, MinIO all do this); separating the admin
  port into its own Service is reserved for specialized namespace-scoped
  NetworkPolicy patterns and was considered and rejected.
- **`cyoda-headless`** (ClusterIP, `clusterIP: None`): two ports, both on
  `7946`, one per protocol —
  `gossip-tcp: 7946/TCP` and `gossip-udp: 7946/UDP`. `hashicorp/memberlist`
  (used by `internal/cluster/registry/gossip.go`) speaks SWIM-style UDP
  probes plus TCP full-state exchange on the same port; a Service declaring
  only TCP silently breaks gossip state convergence.
  `publishNotReadyAddresses: true` so peers discover each other before
  readiness passes — necessary to bootstrap a cluster (otherwise a
  cluster-of-3 never reaches ready because pods can't find peers until
  they're ready, and they can't be ready until they find peers).

### Routing — Gateway API by default, Ingress transitional

**Context.** The Kubernetes SIG-Network `ingress-nginx` project entered
retirement in March 2026 — no further releases, bugfixes, or security
patches. The community successor is the Gateway API
(`gateway.networking.k8s.io`), GA since Kubernetes 1.31, with first-class
`HTTPRoute` and `GRPCRoute` resources. All three major implementations
(Envoy Gateway, Contour, Cilium) support `GRPCRoute` in production. SIG
Network released Ingress2Gateway 1.0 in March 2026 as the migration
assistant.

**Chart decision.** Gateway API is the default path; Ingress is a
transitional compatibility affordance.

- **`gateway.enabled=true`** (default): chart renders one `HTTPRoute` and
  one `GRPCRoute`, each `parentRefs`-ing into an operator-provided shared
  Gateway. `gateway.parentRefs` is required (list of Gateway references).
  `gateway.http.hostnames` and `gateway.grpc.hostnames` scope the routes.
  Chart does **not** render a `Gateway` resource (see Non-goals).
- **`ingress.enabled=true`** (off by default, transitional): chart renders
  two `Ingress` resources, one per protocol. The gRPC Ingress pre-seeds
  `annotations: { "nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol": "GRPC" }`;
  operators on other controllers (Traefik, Kong, HAProxy) override.
  Separate hostnames per protocol (standard for dual-protocol deployments).
- **Mutually exclusive.** `values.schema.json` rejects both-enabled; if the
  schema is bypassed somehow, a chart `fail` template catches it.

**Reference topology documented in the chart README:**

```
          ┌─────────────────────────┐
          │  Cloudflare tunnel /    │
          │  external origin        │

                   └─────────┘
```

The README also documents the legacy Ingress topology for operators
mid-migration, with a pointer to Ingress2Gateway 1.0 for migration tooling.

### NetworkPolicy (default ON)

The admin listener binds `0.0.0.0:9091` so kubelet probes and Prometheus
scrapes can reach it; `/metrics` is bearer-gated at the application
layer (§Observability below). NetworkPolicy is the second line of
defense: even with the bearer enforced, keeping the scrape surface
namespace-scoped means a token leak doesn't expose `/metrics` across
the whole cluster, and gossip-port ingress is locked to chart-managed
pods.

Default `networkPolicy.enabled=true` with a pre-populated
`metricsFromNamespaces` pointing at a namespace labelled
`kubernetes.io/metadata.name: monitoring` (the kube-prometheus-stack
default). Operators on a non-enforcing CNI (kindnet, default EKS with
no secondary CNI, etc.) should set `enabled=false` explicitly to avoid
false-sense-of-security — the rendered policy is a no-op there, and
making the "my cluster doesn't enforce NetworkPolicy" choice explicit
is safer than a silent default.

When enabled:

- **Ingress to the `metrics` port (9091) is restricted** to namespaces
  declared via `networkPolicy.metricsFromNamespaces` — a list of
  `namespaceSelector` entries. The default is
  `[{matchLabels: {kubernetes.io/metadata.name: monitoring}}]`.
- **Ingress to `http` (8080) and `grpc` (9090) is not restricted** — the
  Gateway/Ingress layer is the boundary for application traffic.
- **Ingress to `gossip` (7946, both protocols) is restricted to pods
  matching the cyoda selector** — peer-to-peer traffic from the chart's
  own StatefulSet, nothing else.
- **Egress is not restricted** — cyoda needs reachability to Postgres and
  (via extraEnv) any OTel collector the operator wires in. Fine-grained
  egress is a v0.2 concern.

### Observability

- **Probes:** liveness `/livez`, readiness `/readyz`, both on
  `containerPort metrics` (9091). Unconditional, unauthenticated (kubelet
  probes have no way to present a bearer).
- **`/metrics` requires a Bearer token** on the Helm target. The chart
  sets `CYODA_METRICS_REQUIRE_AUTH=true` in the ConfigMap and mounts the
  token via the fifth projected-volume secret (see §4). Constant-time
  compared on the binary side. This closes the "any in-cluster pod can
  scrape cardinality-revealing labels" exposure that the default
  `0.0.0.0` admin-bind otherwise opens — defense in depth alongside the
  default-on NetworkPolicy.
- **ServiceMonitor** (`monitoring.serviceMonitor.enabled=true`): renders a
  `monitoring.coreos.com/v1 ServiceMonitor` selecting port `metrics` on the
  `cyoda` Service, with a `bearerTokenSecret` block referencing the same
  chart-managed scrape-credential Secret the pod reads from. Prometheus
  Operator mounts the token and the scrape config uses it — end-to-end
  authenticated scrape with no operator wiring needed. Operators add
  selector labels via `monitoring.serviceMonitor.labels` so the
  Prometheus operator's `serviceMonitorSelector` picks it up.
- **Tracing / OTel:** delegated to `extraEnv`. No chart-owned OTel schema —
  the OTel spec evolves fast, and an open env injection is both simpler and
  more forward-compatible.

## 4. Configuration and secret management

### Five credentials

| Credential | Source | Default projected-volume key | Env consumed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CYODA_POSTGRES_URL` | operator `existingSecret` (required) | `dsn` | `CYODA_POSTGRES_URL_FILE` |
| `CYODA_JWT_SIGNING_KEY` | operator `existingSecret` (required) | `signing-key.pem` | `CYODA_JWT_SIGNING_KEY_FILE` |
| `CYODA_HMAC_SECRET` | operator `existingSecret` OR chart-generated | `secret` | `CYODA_HMAC_SECRET_FILE` |
| `CYODA_BOOTSTRAP_CLIENT_SECRET` | operator `existingSecret` OR chart-generated — rendered only when `bootstrap.clientId` is set | `secret` | `CYODA_BOOTSTRAP_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE` |
| `CYODA_METRICS_BEARER` | operator `existingSecret` OR chart-generated | `bearer` | `CYODA_METRICS_BEARER_FILE` |

The metrics bearer is always rendered on the Helm target (the chart
forces `CYODA_METRICS_REQUIRE_AUTH=true`, and the coupled-predicate
validator would refuse to start without the token). The same projected
volume that carries the other four credentials grows a fifth source.
The `ServiceMonitor` template references this Secret via
`bearerTokenSecret` so the same credential flows to Prometheus's scrape
config without operator handwiring.

Each `existingSecret` has a paired `existingSecretKey` values knob so
operators can declare which key in their Secret carries the value — defaults
shown in the table. An operator who stored the DSN under a key called
`postgres-url` sets `postgres.existingSecretKey=postgres-url` and the
projected volume picks it up without renaming the Secret.

### `_FILE` suffix support in the binary

A small config-loader change in the `app` package: a helper
`resolveSecretEnv(name string) string` that returns the value of the named
env var, OR reads `<name>_FILE` as a path and returns that file's contents
(with trailing whitespace trimmed — `TrimRight(data, "\n\r ")` is safe for
both DSN strings and multi-line PEM keys). Applied at the four credential
config sites; no other env vars get `_FILE` treatment (non-secrets don't
need it).

Precedence: `<name>_FILE` wins if both are set. Documented. Tested.

**`extraEnv` collision guidance.** The StatefulSet sets
`CYODA_POSTGRES_URL_FILE`, `CYODA_JWT_SIGNING_KEY_FILE`,
`CYODA_HMAC_SECRET_FILE`, and `CYODA_BOOTSTRAP_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE`
directly on the container. An operator who also sets one of these via
`extraEnv` (perhaps thinking they're overriding the path) hits a
duplicate-env-name rejection from the Kubernetes API at
`helm install`/`upgrade` time, which surfaces as an opaque error. The
chart README and `NOTES.txt` both call out explicitly: **do not set any
`CYODA_*_FILE` or `CYODA_POSTGRES_URL` / `CYODA_JWT_SIGNING_KEY` /
`CYODA_HMAC_SECRET` / `CYODA_BOOTSTRAP_CLIENT_SECRET` via `extraEnv`.**
Those four credentials flow through the projected-volume path driven by
`existingSecret`; override them by changing the referenced Secret, not by
adding an env entry.

Failure modes:

- `<name>_FILE` set, file unreadable → fail fast with a clear error. No
  silent fallthrough to empty.
- `<name>_FILE` set to a file whose contents are empty (after trimming) →
  treated as unset. The normal downstream validation (e.g. "DSN required")
  reports the real problem.

### Auto-generation pattern for chart-managed Secrets

Used for `CYODA_HMAC_SECRET` and `CYODA_BOOTSTRAP_CLIENT_SECRET`. The
template logic, with an explicit GitOps-safety guard:

```yaml
# templates/secret-hmac.yaml
{{- if not .Values.cluster.hmacSecret.existingSecret }}
{{- $name := printf "%s-hmac" (include "cyoda.fullname" .) }}
{{- $key  := .Values.cluster.hmacSecret.existingSecretKey }}
{{- $existing := (lookup "v1" "Secret" .Release.Namespace $name) }}
{{- if not $existing }}
  {{- /* Secret doesn't exist. Verify we have live cluster access before
         generating — otherwise we'd re-randomize on every render (Argo CD
         default path, helm template, --dry-run) and cause continuous
         drift + mid-lifetime HMAC rotation, which breaks the gossip
         encryption key AND the inter-node HTTP dispatch auth. */ -}}
  {{- $ns := (lookup "v1" "Namespace" "" .Release.Namespace) }}
  {{- if not $ns }}
    {{- fail "cluster.hmacSecret.existingSecret is required when the chart is rendered without live cluster access (helm template, Argo CD, --dry-run, or a namespace that does not yet exist — e.g. first-time 'helm install --create-namespace'). Fix: either (a) kubectl create namespace <ns> before running helm install; (b) pre-create the HMAC Secret and set cluster.hmacSecret.existingSecret; or (c) use an operator-managed GitOps path with external-secrets-operator. See the chart README > 'Using with GitOps'." }}
  {{- end }}
{{- end }}
{{- $value := "" }}
{{- if $existing }}
{{- $value = index $existing.data $key }}
{{- else }}
{{- $value = randAlphaNum 48 | b64enc }}
{{- end }}
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: {{ $name }}
  labels: {{- include "cyoda.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
type: Opaque
data:
  {{ $key }}: {{ $value | quote }}
{{- end }}
```

The chart-managed path honors `existingSecretKey` symmetrically: whatever
key the operator declared (default `secret`) is both what the generated
Secret writes to AND what the pod's projected volume reads from. This
keeps "value is written and read under the same key" as an invariant
regardless of which subset of `existingSecret` / `existingSecretKey` the
operator sets. If we hardcoded `secret:` here, an operator who set
`existingSecretKey: myhmac` without `existingSecret` would get a pod that
fails to mount — the chart would write to key `secret` but the volume
would read key `myhmac`.

**GitOps safety guard (the critical bit).** `lookup` returns nil when the
chart is rendered without live cluster access (Argo CD's default path runs
`helm template`; also `helm template`, `--dry-run`, and some CI scenarios).
Without the guard, the template would take the `else` branch on every
reconcile and generate a fresh `randAlphaNum`, which the GitOps controller
would then apply, silently rotating the Secret. For HMAC this breaks both
gossip encryption AND inter-node HTTP dispatch auth
(`internal/cluster/dispatch/forwarder.go`) mid-cluster-lifetime — a
correctness bug, not just an ergonomic annoyance.

The guard uses a second `lookup` on the namespace as a live-cluster
detector. If the namespace lookup returns empty, we're either in a render
mode without live access OR installing into a namespace that doesn't
exist yet (`helm install --create-namespace` case). Both cases require
the operator to either (a) pre-create the namespace and retry, or (b)
provide `existingSecret`. The chart fails with a clear, actionable message.

Bitnami charts and several other mature charts have the same silent-drift
bug without this guard; the guard isn't standard but is necessary for
correctness in GitOps-heavy environments, which is most operator clusters
in 2026.

**Properties (once past the guard):**

- **First install (live cluster, Secret doesn't yet exist):** `randAlphaNum 48`
  generates a new value → Secret is created. 48 chars of alphanumeric at
  ~5.95 bits per char ≈ 285 bits of entropy; well above what either HMAC
  or the bootstrap client secret needs.
- **Subsequent upgrades (Secret exists):** `lookup` finds the existing
  Secret → reuses its value → Secret stays stable.
- **`helm uninstall`:** chart-managed Secrets are deleted along with the
  rest of the release. Reinstalling generates fresh values. Operators who
  want stability across uninstall+install use `existingSecret`. (No
  `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep` on either secret — see "Secret retention
  semantics" below.)

**Secret retention semantics.** Neither chart-managed Secret uses
`resource-policy: keep`, deliberately:

- For **HMAC**: the secret isn't bound to persisted state. It encrypts
  gossip messages and authenticates inter-node HTTP forwards — both are
  live-cluster operations. When `helm uninstall` removes all pods, no
  cluster members exist to carry state forward. Reinstall produces a fresh
  HMAC and a fresh cluster; Postgres data is external and unaffected. The
  earlier rationale for `keep` (avoiding "lockout from previously-written
  data") doesn't apply because the data lives in Postgres, not in anything
  the HMAC signs.
- For **bootstrap client secret**: this is app-level M2M auth. Operators
  may be deliberately rotating credentials away. `helm uninstall && helm
  install` with `keep` would resurrect a credential the operator rotated
  out, which is surprising in the wrong direction.
- For **both**: the right semantic is "chart-managed = lifecycle-bound to
  the release." Operators who want cross-uninstall stability use
  `existingSecret`; operators who want fresh secrets on reinstall let the
  chart manage them. Clean, symmetric mental model.

**Bootstrap tightening (binary side) — coupled predicate.** The existing
binary behavior of auto-generating `CYODA_BOOTSTRAP_CLIENT_SECRET` when
unset and printing it to stdout is removed. Rationale: in a Kubernetes
pod, that stdout print goes into log aggregation (a small but real
secret leak), and the "generated-once, printed-once" UX is lost on
rolling restarts anyway.

New validation semantics, grounded in the binary's actual call graph
(`app/app.go:186` creates the bootstrap M2M client only when
`CYODA_BOOTSTRAP_CLIENT_ID != ""`; the secret is consumed only inside
that gate):

- **In `mock` mode:** both vars ignored.
- **In `jwt` mode, both empty:** legitimate. Operator authenticates via
  JWKS / external signing keys; no bootstrap M2M client is created.
- **In `jwt` mode, both set:** legitimate. Bootstrap M2M client created
  at startup.
- **In `jwt` mode, ID set but secret unset:** rejected. Would fail
  client creation.
- **In `jwt` mode, secret set but ID unset:** rejected. Secret would be
  silently ignored; loud rejection surfaces the misconfiguration.

The error message names both vars so operators know which one to fix.
Laptop users who want bootstrap set both explicitly in their `.env`;
laptop users who don't need bootstrap leave both empty and still start
cleanly. Chart users get the bootstrap Secret auto-generated only when
they set `bootstrap.clientId` (see below).

**Chart behavior — bootstrap is opt-in.** The chart defaults
`bootstrap.clientId = ""` and consequently does NOT render a bootstrap
Secret or the `CYODA_BOOTSTRAP_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE` env. Operators who
want a bootstrap M2M client set `bootstrap.clientId` to a value
(commonly `"cyoda-bootstrap"`); the chart then either auto-generates a
secret (via the `lookup`+GitOps-guard pattern) or uses the operator's
`bootstrap.clientSecret.existingSecret`. Matches the opt-in pattern
used elsewhere (ServiceMonitor, NetworkPolicy, Ingress): security-
sensitive features are explicit.

### ConfigMap / Secret split

Non-secret env vars go in a single ConfigMap referenced from the pod spec
via `envFrom: [{ configMapRef: { name: <fullname>-env } }]`. Sensitive
values never touch a ConfigMap; non-sensitive values never touch a Secret.

Example ConfigMap contents:

```yaml
CYODA_HTTP_PORT: "8080"
CYODA_GRPC_PORT: "9090"
CYODA_ADMIN_PORT: "9091"
CYODA_ADMIN_BIND_ADDRESS: "0.0.0.0"
CYODA_IAM_MODE: "jwt"
CYODA_REQUIRE_JWT: "true"
CYODA_STORAGE_BACKEND: "postgres"
CYODA_POSTGRES_AUTO_MIGRATE: "false"
CYODA_LOG_LEVEL: {{ .Values.logLevel | quote }}
CYODA_JWT_ISSUER: {{ .Values.jwt.issuer | quote }}
CYODA_JWT_EXPIRY_SECONDS: {{ .Values.jwt.expirySeconds | quote }}
CYODA_BOOTSTRAP_CLIENT_ID: {{ .Values.bootstrap.clientId | quote }}
CYODA_BOOTSTRAP_TENANT_ID: {{ .Values.bootstrap.tenantId | quote }}
CYODA_BOOTSTRAP_USER_ID: {{ .Values.bootstrap.userId | quote }}
CYODA_BOOTSTRAP_ROLES: {{ .Values.bootstrap.roles | quote }}
```

## 5. Migration flow

Three moving pieces, one end-to-end flow.

### Binary — `cyoda migrate` subcommand

New file `cmd/cyoda/migrate.go`, new dispatch case in `cmd/cyoda/main.go`:

```go
// main.go
case "migrate":
    os.Exit(runMigrate(os.Args[2:]))
```

`runMigrate` behavior:

- Parses `--timeout` flag (default 5 min) for the migration run.
- Loads the exact same env config the server does (via the same config loader
  — including the new `_FILE` suffix resolution from §4). No config
  duplication.
- Selects the backend based on `CYODA_STORAGE_BACKEND`. Memory and sqlite
  backends have no migrations; subcommand exits 0 with an info log. Postgres
  backend runs its migration logic.
- **Forward-only, idempotent.** Running twice is a no-op the second time
  (existing `applyMigrations` semantics in the Postgres plugin check
  `schema_version`).
- **Respects the schema-compatibility contract.** If DB schema is newer than
  code (downgrade rollback scenario), exits non-zero with the same error the
  server would produce. The migrate subcommand never silently allows a
  state where "migrations ran but they were backward migrations".
- **Exits cleanly.** No lingering goroutines, no admin listener, no
  background loops. Short-lived process.
- **Logs at info:** "migrations applied: N → M; duration: Xs".

Tested via `cmd/cyoda/migrate_test.go`:

- Unit: memory/sqlite backends no-op exit 0.
- E2E: against testcontainers Postgres — migrates a fresh DB; re-running is
  a no-op; artificially-advanced schema version triggers the compat refusal.

### Chart — migration Job

`templates/job-migrate.yaml` renders a Helm hook Job:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: {{ include "cyoda.fullname" . }}-migrate-{{ .Release.Revision }}
  labels: {{- include "cyoda.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
  annotations:
    helm.sh/hook: pre-install,pre-upgrade
    helm.sh/hook-weight: "0"
    helm.sh/hook-delete-policy: before-hook-creation,hook-succeeded
spec:
  backoffLimit: {{ .Values.migrate.backoffLimit }}
  activeDeadlineSeconds: {{ .Values.migrate.activeDeadlineSeconds }}
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      serviceAccountName: cyoda
      automountServiceAccountToken: false
      securityContext: { /* same hardening as the main StatefulSet pod */ }
      containers:
      - name: migrate
        image: ghcr.io/cyoda-platform/cyoda:{{ .Chart.AppVersion }}
        command: [/cyoda, migrate]
        envFrom: [{ configMapRef: { name: {{ include "cyoda.fullname" . }}-env } }]
        env:
        - name: CYODA_POSTGRES_URL_FILE
          value: /etc/cyoda/secrets/postgres-dsn
        volumeMounts:
        - name: secrets
          mountPath: /etc/cyoda/secrets
          readOnly: true
        resources: { /* .Values.migrate.resources */ }
      volumes:
      - name: secrets
        projected:
          defaultMode: 0400
          sources:
          - secret:
              name: {{ .Values.postgres.existingSecret }}
              items: [{ key: dsn, path: postgres-dsn }]
```

**Properties:**

- **Unique per revision** (`{{ .Release.Revision }}` in the name) — Helm
  revision numbers increment on every upgrade, so Job object names never
  collide.
- **`hook-delete-policy: before-hook-creation,hook-succeeded`** — successful
  Jobs clean up (no `kubectl get jobs` pile-up); failed Jobs are retained
  for `kubectl logs` postmortem.
- **Only mounts the DSN.** Principle of least privilege — the migration
  step doesn't need JWT keys, HMAC, or the bootstrap client secret.
- **Same hardened pod spec** as the main StatefulSet (non-root,
  `readOnlyRootFilesystem`, all capabilities dropped).
- **`backoffLimit: 2`, `activeDeadlineSeconds: 600` (10 min)** defaults.
  Operators running large migrations override via
  `migrate.activeDeadlineSeconds`.

### End-to-end rollout

`helm upgrade cyoda cyoda/cyoda --version 0.2.0` (new chart ships with a
new `appVersion` whose image includes a schema change):

1. Helm renders manifests, including the new
   `cyoda-migrate-<new-revision>` Job.
2. Helm creates the Job. Job pod pulls the new image, runs `cyoda migrate`,
   applies missing migrations, exits 0.
3. Helm sees Job success; applies the StatefulSet update.
4. StatefulSet rolls pods. Each new pod starts with `AUTO_MIGRATE=false`
   and its schema-compat check passes because migrations already ran.
5. Rolling completes. Old pods terminate. Release succeeds.

### Failure modes

- **Migration fails (new schema has a bug):** Job exits non-zero after
  `backoffLimit` retries → `helm upgrade` fails → Helm's rollback logic
  restores the prior release's values → StatefulSet untouched → old pods
  keep serving. Operator `kubectl logs job/cyoda-migrate-<rev>` diagnoses.
- **Migration takes longer than `activeDeadlineSeconds`:** Job killed →
  same as failure path. Surfaces "this migration is slow" loudly.
- **Schema newer than code (downgrade):** `cyoda migrate` refuses (by
  design) → Job fails → `helm upgrade` fails → old release stays in place.

### Rollback and downgrade explicitly out of scope

cyoda-go Postgres migrations are forward-only. An operator trying to
downgrade the chart to an older `appVersion` that expects an older schema
will hit: migrate Job refuses → `helm upgrade` fails → old release
preserved. If they force past that (e.g. `helm rollback`), the old binaries
will hit the schema-compat refusal on startup and crash-loop. **Recovery
requires a DB restore from backup.** Chart README documents this explicitly;
it's not something the Helm layer can or should fix. This matches the
shared-spec fail-closed contract.

---

## 6. Release mechanics

Two GitHub Actions workflows, both currently pre-stubs in the repo, start
doing real work when this deliverable lands.

### `release-chart.yml` — publish chart

**Trigger:** tag push matching `cyoda-*` (e.g. `cyoda-0.1.0`).

**Steps:**

1. Checkout at the tag.
2. **Verify GitHub Pages is configured** via
   `gh api repos/${{github.repository}}/pages` — fails fast with a clear
   message if Pages isn't enabled on the repo. First-release workflow
   failures where Pages was never configured (tag pushed, `gh-pages`
   populated, but `index.yaml` is 404) are a common foot-gun; this check
   surfaces the misconfiguration at release time rather than after an
   operator reports the 404.
3. Verify `deploy/helm/cyoda/Chart.yaml` exists (fails the release
   otherwise — already scaffolded).
4. Verify `Chart.yaml` `version:` matches the tag suffix
   (`cyoda-0.2.0` requires `version: 0.2.0`). Prevents mis-tagged
   releases.
5. `helm lint deploy/helm/cyoda`.
6. `helm template` + `kubeconform` (same checks as CI's layer 1 — see §7).
7. `helm/chart-releaser-action@v1` packages the chart and publishes to the
   `gh-pages` branch as a Helm repository
   (`index.yaml` + `<name>-<version>.tgz`).
8. The .tgz is also uploaded to the GitHub Release matching the tag, so
   `helm pull` against the Release asset works as an alternative.

**Pre-release prerequisite (documented in `MAINTAINING.md`):** Before the
first `cyoda-*` tag, the repo maintainer must enable GitHub Pages in the
repo settings with source "Deploy from a branch" and branch
`gh-pages:/(root)`. This is a one-time step. The workflow's step-2 check
above catches the case where this is skipped.

**Published URL:** `https://cyoda-platform.github.io/cyoda-go` (GitHub
Pages, served from the `gh-pages` branch).

### `bump-chart-appversion.yml` — keep appVersion aligned with binary

**Trigger:** tag push matching `v*` non-prerelease (e.g. `v0.2.0`, not
`v0.2.0-rc.1`).

**Steps:**

1. Checkout `main` in a new branch `chore/bump-chart-appversion-<version>`.
2. Use `mikefarah/yq` action to update the `appVersion` field in
   `deploy/helm/cyoda/Chart.yaml`:
   `yq eval '.appVersion = strenv(VERSION)' -i deploy/helm/cyoda/Chart.yaml`.
   `sed` was considered and rejected — brittle against YAML quoting
   variations and multi-doc files. `yq` is a standard GitHub Actions step
   and eliminates a class of silent misedits.
3. Does NOT touch chart `version:` — that's an independent semver (chart
   changes ≠ app changes).
4. Opens a PR against `main` with a description referencing the binary
   release notes.
5. Does NOT auto-merge. A human reviews and decides whether the appVersion
   bump warrants a chart release (if so, they also bump chart `version` in
   the same PR and tag the chart after merge).

This separation — binary releases and chart releases are independent tag
series with their own semver — is the standard pattern
(ingress-nginx, Grafana, cert-manager all do this). Chart bug fixes ship
without binary bumps; binary bumps ship without chart changes.

### Chart versioning — v0.1.0 start

- **Chart version:** `0.1.0`. First published chart. Going forward:
  - Patch (`0.1.1`): template bugfix, no values schema changes.
  - Minor (`0.2.0`): additive values schema change, new optional feature.
  - Major (`1.0.0`): commit to stable values schema; breaking changes
    require a major.
- **appVersion:** concrete binary tag at chart-ship time. Tracks the binary
  via `bump-chart-appversion.yml` PRs.

### Operator consumption

```bash
# Add the repo
helm repo add cyoda https://cyoda-platform.github.io/cyoda-go
helm repo update

# Install
helm install cyoda cyoda/cyoda -f my-values.yaml

# Pin to a specific chart version
helm install cyoda cyoda/cyoda --version 0.1.0 -f my-values.yaml

# Upgrade (migration Job runs automatically pre-upgrade)
helm upgrade cyoda cyoda/cyoda --version 0.2.0 -f my-values.yaml
```

OCI-based chart publishing (to `ghcr.io`) was considered and rejected for
v0.1: `helm search repo` doesn't work against OCI registries, and
chart-releaser is the more-traveled path that most mainstream charts still
use. OCI publishing is a future-version consideration, not a current need.

---

## 7. Testing and CI

### Layer 1 — lint + template + validate (every chart-affecting PR)

New workflow `.github/workflows/helm-chart-ci.yml`. Triggered on PRs that
touch `deploy/helm/**` or the workflow file itself; also runs on pushes to
`main`.

**Job `helm-lint-and-validate` steps:**

1. Checkout, install Helm v4.1.x.
2. Install `kubeconform` v0.6.7.
3. `helm lint deploy/helm/cyoda`.
4. `helm template cyoda deploy/helm/cyoda` with **three overlays**, each
   piped into `kubeconform -strict -kubernetes-version 1.31.0` with
   Gateway API 1.2 schemas:
   - Default (single replica, Gateway API enabled).
   - Ingress-mode override (`gateway.enabled=false`, `ingress.enabled=true`).
   - Three-replica cluster-mode (`replicas=3`, Gateway enabled).
5. Every overlay provides fixture secrets via `--set postgres.existingSecret=test-dsn`
   and `--set jwt.existingSecret=test-jwt` (the Secret objects don't need to
   exist at template-time; we're only rendering, not installing).

Runtime: ~30 seconds. Catches template syntax errors, missing-required-values
failures, invalid Kubernetes object schemas, Gateway API schema violations.

### Layer 2 — `ct install` on kind (chart-affecting PRs + main)

**Job `helm-install-smoke` steps** (runs after layer 1 passes):

1. Checkout.
2. `helm/kind-action@v1` creates a kind cluster, Kubernetes v1.31.0.
3. Install Gateway API v1.2 CRDs from the upstream manifest.
4. Install Envoy Gateway via its official Helm chart (one-liner; ~60s
   wait). Chosen as the reference Gateway implementation for CI because it
   has full `HTTPRoute`/`GRPCRoute` support with no known scale caveats.
5. Create a Postgres sidecar pod (postgres:16-alpine) with a fixed
   password and `cyoda` database.
6. Generate fixture material at CI-runtime and create Secrets:
   - Generate an ephemeral RSA private key with `openssl genrsa -out
     /tmp/test-jwt.pem 2048`. The key lives only for the CI job — no
     committed private key in the repo.
   - `test-dsn` Secret containing the Postgres DSN against the sidecar.
   - `test-jwt` Secret containing the generated key under
     `signing-key.pem`.
7. `helm/chart-testing-action@v2` `ct install` — installs the chart, waits
   for `--timeout 5m`, uninstalls, re-installs (exercises the
   `lookup`-based chart-managed Secret pattern on re-install).
8. Port-forward the `cyoda` Service's `metrics` port; `curl -fsS
   http://localhost:9091/readyz` to confirm end-to-end readiness.
9. `helm test cyoda` — runs the chart's own `test-readyz` hook pod, which
   curls `/readyz` via in-cluster DNS.

Runtime: ~2.5 minutes. Catches real install failures the layer-1 schema
check can't see: Secret-wiring mismatches, probe path misses, migration Job
failures, `envFrom` references that don't resolve, Gateway API schema
issues `kubeconform` misses.

### Out of layer 2 — followed up explicitly

- **Upgrade testing.** Requires two chart versions with a schema diff.
  Filed as §8-F2.
- **Multi-replica cluster-mode gossip coordination.** Requires substantial
  extra infra (3-pod wait, gossip peer-count assertion via logs or admin
  endpoint). Filed as §8-F1.

### Test fixtures

- **No committed private keys.** The CI job generates an ephemeral RSA key
  inline via `openssl genrsa` at runtime. No `test-jwt.pem` or equivalent
  lives in the repo — this avoids the "committed dev-key that might end up
  in a non-CI context" concern raised in the security rules.
- `.github/ct.yaml` — chart-testing config:
  ```yaml
  chart-dirs: [deploy/helm]
  charts: [cyoda]
  validate-maintainers: false
  helm-extra-args: "--wait --timeout 5m"
  target-branch: main
  ```

### Integration with existing CI

- Existing `ci.yml` (Go tests) — no change.
- Existing `per-module-hygiene` job (plugin submodule builds) — no change.
- New `helm-chart-ci.yml` runs independently, does not block non-chart PRs.
- `release-chart.yml` and `bump-chart-appversion.yml` pre-stubs become
  operative once chart files land.

## 8. Follow-up issues

Filed as GitHub issues on PR merge. These are deferred with clear reasons —
never buried as TODOs in code.

| ID | Title | Reason deferred | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | Layer 3 CI: multi-replica cluster-mode install with gossip coordination | Requires substantial extra test infrastructure; value is real but independent from the v0.1 baseline | CI job installs chart at `replicas=3, gateway.enabled=true`, verifies 3 pods reach Ready, verifies `gossip.go` logs "cluster of 3", tears down cleanly. Runs on main + nightly. |
| F2 | `helm upgrade` migration-path testing | Needs two chart versions with a schema diff; impossible at v0.1 in isolation | When v0.2 ships with a schema change, add CI: install v0.1.0, upgrade to v0.2.0, verify migration Job ran and new pods serve traffic. |
| F3 | Ingress2Gateway migration guide | Operator-facing documentation deliverable, not chart code | `deploy/helm/cyoda/docs/migrating-from-ingress.md` walks `ingress.enabled=true` → `gateway.enabled=true` via Ingress2Gateway 1.0. |
| F4 | Gateway API PolicyAttachment patterns (rate limiting, auth filters) | Specific to each operator's Gateway controller; not chart-universal | Document recommended `BackendTrafficPolicy` / `SecurityPolicy` overlays for Envoy Gateway; do not render from chart. |
| F5 | Chart v0.2+ optional features | Not needed for the v0.1 baseline; each is a separable increment | Each feature (HPA, PodMonitor alternative, external-secrets-operator integration, fine-grained egress NetworkPolicy) becomes its own minor chart version with its own values schema addition and tests. |

Picked up by this deliverable from existing context:

- `_FILE` suffix support for credentials — closed by §4 + §1 binary changes.
- Plugin submodule test coverage aggregator (existing issue #46) — not
  touched by this deliverable; stays open.

## 9. Summary of decisions

For quick cross-reference against the clarifying-question trail:

| Area | Decision |
|---|---|
| Migration mode | New `cyoda migrate` subcommand |
| DB subchart | None. Chart has zero dependencies. DSN required via `existingSecret`. |
| DSN secret wiring | `existingSecret` only; never plaintext in values |
| JWT key wiring | `existingSecret`, required. `_FILE` suffix convention applied uniformly. |
| `_FILE` suffix scope | All four credential-shaped env vars. Single `resolveSecretEnv` helper. |
| Migration Job hooks | `pre-install,pre-upgrade`, blocking. 10-min default `activeDeadlineSeconds`. |
| Workload kind | StatefulSet always. Cluster mode always on. Scale via `replicas` alone. |
| HMAC secret | Auto-generated via `lookup` + `randAlphaNum 48` with GitOps-safety guard, or operator `existingSecret`. No `resource-policy: keep`. |
| Bootstrap client secret | Same auto-gen pattern with the same guard. Binary: stdout-print removed; jwt mode requires it. No `resource-policy: keep`. |
| GitOps safety | `lookup`-based auto-gen guarded by a namespace-lookup check; chart fails with a clear message when rendered without live cluster access, forcing operators to use `existingSecret`. |
| Secret key names | Every `existingSecret` has a paired `existingSecretKey` values knob so operators declare their key name. |
| Service shape | Single ClusterIP `cyoda` with named ports `http/grpc/metrics` + headless `cyoda-headless` for gossip |
| Routing | Gateway API default (`HTTPRoute` + `GRPCRoute`, parentRefs required); Ingress transitional |
| Gateway resource rendering | No. Shared platform Gateway expected; chart renders only routes. |
| Observability | Unconditional probes + optional ServiceMonitor + open `extraEnv` for OTel |
| Pod security | Non-root 65532, readOnlyRootFilesystem, all caps dropped, seccomp RuntimeDefault, SA token not mounted |
| NetworkPolicy | Optional template, off by default. When enabled, restricts metrics-port ingress to operator-declared namespaces and gossip-port ingress to the chart's own pods. |
| imagePullSecrets | Top-level values knob wired into pod spec; supports air-gapped/mirrored registries. |
| extraEnv shape | Schema-constrained to `{name, value}` or `{name, valueFrom}`; supports injecting `secretKeyRef` entries (OTel auth headers, etc.). |
| Storage backend | Postgres only. ConfigMap hardcodes it; no user-facing values knob. |
| Persistence | None. `volumeClaimTemplates: []`. |
| Chart publishing | `helm/chart-releaser-action` → GitHub Pages |
| CI | Layers 1 (every PR) + 2 (chart-affecting PRs + main). Layer 3 filed as F1. |
