// streaming_greet_send_test.go — one goroutine, and only one, ever calls the
// raw send on a member's stream.
//
// The greet is queued as the writer's first item, before Register publishes
// the member, so it is written first and no dispatch can precede it. Every
// later write goes through the same member outbox and so through the same
// single writer goroutine. If the greet were instead written to the stream
// directly, it would run concurrently with the first dispatch's write — which
// grpc-go documents as unsupported, and whose failure mode is a corrupted
// HTTP/2 frame, not a clean error. This test parks the first raw send and
// pushes a second write at the stream to prove the two never overlap.
