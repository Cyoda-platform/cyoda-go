// A member is published to the registry before its writer puts the greet on
// the wire. The greet is the member's "you are registered" signal: a client
// that holds it, and any test that looks the member up the instant it sees
// it, must find the member. When the writer was started before the map
// insert, a fast writer could send the greet first and the lookup answered
// nil ("member not found" on CI). The probe is the send function itself:
// it runs on the writer goroutine at the moment the greet goes out, so what
// the registry holds right then is exactly what a client could observe.
